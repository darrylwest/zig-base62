# Zig Base62 Encode/Decode

## Overview

Base62 encoding converts numbers to ASCII strings (0-9, a-z and A-Z) and vice versa, which typically results in much short strings. 
These strings are ideal for key/value database keys because they are short and can hide time-based + random encrytion integers to manageable lengths.
